- See https://github.com/VEEXH/Ghost-Path-Traversal-CVE-2023-32235- 


# setup

- To test it locally, you need to setup hackyeaster.com to point to localhost by editing /etc/hosts.
- On first run you will encounter a few db error from blog_1 until database mysql_1 is ready.
- PS: One can register to the blog as user (I setup mail functionality), but it's a rabbit hole.
